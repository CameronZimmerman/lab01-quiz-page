                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class = "intro-content">Hello! and thank you so much for taking the time to participate in a quiz that focuses on me. A little self centered I'll admit...  but hey I need the points. Anywho here is some information about me. 
                </p>

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class = "about-me-content">My name is Cameron Andrew Zimmerman and I am 20 years old. I was born in Sacramento CA but have lived in a myriad of different states. My favorite food is Tortellini with white sauce. I am a Software Engineer. My favorite passtimes include gaming, game development, ukulele, and reading with my Wife. If I were to describe myself as an animal... I would most likely say Gerbil. HOWEVER, if I could be any animal I would choose to be a flying squirrel. I find it difficult at times to be an incredibly social person and tend to suffer from a smidgemidgeon of social anxiety. So it is my mission to plunge myself into as many social situations as possible. I'm currently starting a new chapter in my life as a Software Developer. I've loved tech my whole life, however it took a little bit of self reflection to finally realize that I can make my passion into my career. My dad swears up and down that when I was 5 I wanted to be a Dentist. I have no such memory and frankly I'm glad I don't remember a time when I wanted to be a dentist... Thanks for reading!
